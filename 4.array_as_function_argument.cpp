// In the context of function parameters, `arr[]` and `*arr` are not exactly the same; however, they are related concepts when working with arrays as function arguments in C and C++. 

// Let's break down the differences:

// 1. arr[] as a Function Parameter:

//    When you define a function parameter like `int arr[]`, you're indicating that the parameter is expected to be an array of integers. However, in reality, this notation is equivalent to using a pointer. 
// void myFunction(int arr[], int size) {
//     // Code
// }

//    cpp
//    void myFunction(int arr[], int size) {
//    In this context, `arr[]` indicates that the parameter `arr` is a pointer to the first element of an integer array. This pointer can be used to access the elements of the array. The square brackets in this notation are a hint that the parameter is expected to point to the beginning of an array.

// 2.*arr` as a Function Parameter:

//    Similarly, you can define a function parameter using the pointer notation: `int* arr`. This explicitly states that the parameter is a pointer to an integer.

//   cpp
//    void myFunction(int* arr, int size) {
//    }
//    Here, `arr` is declared as a pointer to an integer. This means it can point to the start of an array of integers and be used to access the elements.

// 3. **Using `arr[]` and `*arr` in Function Calls:**

//    When you call a function, you don't use `arr[]` or `*arr`; you simply use the array name. The array name itself is a pointer to the first element of the array. So, when you call the function, you're essentially passing a pointer.

//    ```cpp
//    int myArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//    myFunction(myArray, 5); // Passing the pointer to the first element
//    ```

// In summary, while `arr[]` and `*arr` are not strictly the same, they are closely related because arrays, when used as function parameters, effectively decay into pointers to their first elements. In both cases, you're working with a pointer to the beginning of an array. The choice between `arr[]` and `*arr` as a parameter notation depends on style and readability preferences, but they accomplish the same task of allowing you to pass arrays as arguments.
